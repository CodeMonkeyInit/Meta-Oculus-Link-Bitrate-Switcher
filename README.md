# Oculus Link Bitrate Switcher

Basic command line tool to "switch" Oculus Link mode.
When Oculus/Meta Quest is connected by cable sets fixed 500mb/s bitrate and forces HEVC codec. 
And resets to default (wireless AirLink) when it's not.

## Main project is OculusQuestBitrateSwitcher. Companion app is just a stub for now
